# End of Sixth Week
## 10/13/2017
I built a website this week. The website was a pizza ordering site. It has checkboxes and circles to select the size, style, and toppings of the pizza.
The submit button didn't work but Mr. Gold said it was okay. I added pictures of all the toppings. I wanted to make the picture smaller, but I did it the
wrong way so I had to leave them the same size.

banner at the top of the webpage to be able to switch between the four 
different pages.

This week I started on a new project. I was to make a logo for my favorite

out the word with text, I made bubble letters and drew each line individualy.
