# End of Sixth Week
## 10/13/2017
I built a website this week. The website was a pizza ordering site. It has checkboxes and circles to select the size, style, and toppings of the pizza.
The submit button didn't work but Mr. Gold said it was okay. I added pictures of all the toppings. I wanted to make the picture smaller, but I did it the
wrong way so I had to leave them the same size.

# End of Seventh and Eigth Week
## 10/23/2017 
During these past two weeks I made a website about my hobby. This website was
based on pokemon and how they evolved over time. I added a blog, gallery, and
evolution chart, which I am currently making in MS Paint. I also added a
banner at the top of the webpage to be able to switch between the four 
different pages.
